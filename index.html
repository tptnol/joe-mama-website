<h1>Joe Mama</h1>
  
<p></p>
<h2>Who's Joe?</h2>
<p>"I'm serious dude <i>who's joe</i>? Seriously who is he? Bro, c'mon bro tell me who he is." - <a href="https://stayhipp.com/internet/memes/who-is-joe-mama/">joe</a>.</p>
  
<h2>What's Ligma?</h2>
<p>Popular Mixer streamer Tyler "Ninja" Blevins sadly has been diagnosed with the rare disease of <b>Ligma</b>. The disease is known to rupture the arteries and send victims in a hemorrhagic shock, and has been spread to more than just the popular Fortnite streamer. Other big names in the industry have contracted the disease, including Drake, Juice Wrld, and PewDiePie. The epidemic is now upon the human race, will you survive?</p>

<h2>What's Sugma?</h2>
<p><b>Sugma</b> is the precursor to Ligma, but is not as contagious and often sporting less severe reactions. This is not to say that it is not a threat, as it is definitely capable of inducing heart problems and kidney failure. It's main difference is that it cannot actually kill a person, but instead evolve into Ligma, a more lethal illness.</p>

<h2>Where's Sugonda?</h2>
<p>The <b>Sugondese</b> people are located in the area near both Indonesia and New Zealand, but is most notably the place where this disease was first documented. Many scientists attribute the island's hot climate and minimal precipitation to its creation, and its main spread was through its constant trading with other countries. Sugonda is infamous for its grasp on the international market, often trading with countries across the world.</p>

<h2>What's Updog?</h2>
<p>As with most diseases, many signs and symptoms can appear to confirm whether or not you are infected. The most notorious symptom would be the smell of "<b>updog</b>", which is said to be a mix of both air and dogs. After a while the symptom will then move to take over the brain, prompting victims to say the words, "Nuuthing dog, what's up with you?" When heard, do not respond, since you might run the risk of getting the disease yourself.</p>

<h1>I pray for the safety of America.</h1>
